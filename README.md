| Malware attacks: Malicious software | Antivirus, antimalware (AMW) software, firewalls                      | AMW: Signature-based (known malware) and behaviour-based detection (suspicious activity). |
| Phishing attacks                    | User education, email filtering, network traffic flagging             |                                                                                           |
| Denial-of-service attacks           | Network capacity, CDN, intrusion detection & prevention system (IDPS) | IDPS monitors network traffic and warns or blocks                                         |

| Malware detection | AI has the potential to provide much more accurate and faster detection of malicious activity than traditional signature-based detection. To design this kind of system, you would need to first create a data set of network traffic. This data set would need to include both malicious and benign traffic so that the AI could learn to distinguish between the two. | Network traffic dataset |            |
